**EPIDEMIC** is an easy to run educational Matlab code for epidemiological simulation. The package consists of three modules: 

- **Compartmental models:** dynamical systems that emulate the behavior of homogeneous populations in an epidemic. 
- **Forecasting models:** statistical regressors for making short-term predictions based on epidemic data.
- **Trend models:** trend graphs that analyze the dynamic behavior of the epidemic in a certain type of "phase space"
