**EPIDEMIC** is an easy to run educational Matlab code for epidemiological analysis, which offers functionalities for modeling an epidemic, monitoring its progress and forecasting the underling numbers of interest. This code is, first of all, an educational tool for researchers and students who are interested in computational epidemiology. The programs and tutorials are designed to offer good introductory material for beginners in the field. But they can also be used to analyze epidemic data, as well as in the construction of some simplistic epidemic models. The package is structured in 3 independent modules:
- **Modeling:** which uses differential equation-based compartmental models to emulate the dynamic behavior of homogeneous populations during an epidemic scenario;
- **Trends:** which uses several types of trend graphs to analyze the dynamic behavior of an epidemic as well as its underlyng rate of progress;
- **Forecast:** which uses data-driven statistical regressors to make short-term predictions about certain quantities of interest underlying the epidemic.
