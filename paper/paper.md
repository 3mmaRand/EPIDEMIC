# Computational epidemiology

The aim of epidemiology is to understand the causes of a disease in
order to predict its evolution and then make decisions to contain the
epidemic. Thus, epidemiology is of great importance to society.

The study of the spread of a disease leads to the generation of large
data sets that require the use of computational methods to generate
epidemiological models and analyze results for decision making
[@Tameru:2012]. In this context, computational epidemiology arises,
which over time has become increasingly multidisciplinary (techniques of
epidemiology, biology, mathematics, theoretical computer science,
machine learning, etc.) and led to the development of new computational
methods to understand and control the spread of disease [@Marathe:2013].
